#### Title:
Visualizing the impact of climate change on flight experience

#### Description:
This visualization explores the monthly trends in flight cancellations and passenger complaints for the major airline carriers operating in the Indian civil aviation sector for years 2014-18, against the temperature and rainfall values. Being a tropical country, India experiences prominent summer and monsoon seasons that potentially affect the flight experience. This exploration then goes on to compare airline carriers and looks at the upcoming holidays to help the passengers make more informed travel decisions.
